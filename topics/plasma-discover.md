## Software Installation and Update

### Description

This details how to install desktop applications and update them.

### Steps

While in desktop mode, you're able to install desktop apps via **Flatpaks** for everyday use.

This is done using the **Discover** app. To install apps, simply launch the app and search/browse for the apps you wish to install, click on them, and install them.

If any updates are available to these apps, they will appear in the **Updates** section found in the bottom left of the side panel in the Discover app.

To update apps, just go to the Updates section and update your apps accordingly.

Some apps I recommend installing from Discover (as Flatpaks):

- Plex
